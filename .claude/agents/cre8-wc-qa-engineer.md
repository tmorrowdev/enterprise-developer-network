**cre8-wc Integration Testing Patterns:**
```javascript
// Integration testing for cre8-wc components
import { fixture, html, expect } from '@open-wc/testing';
import '@cre8-dev/cre8-wc/components/button';
import '@cre8-dev/cre8-wc/components/card';

describe('cre8-wc Component Integration', () => {
  it('should properly integrate cre8-button with theme', async () => {
    const el = await fixture(html`
      <cre8-card theme="custom">
        <cre8-button variant="primary">Click me</cre8-button>
      </cre8-card>
    `);
    
    const button = el.querySelector('cre8-button');
    expect(button).to.exist;
    expect(button.getAttribute('variant')).to.equal('primary');
  });

  it('should handle cre8-wc events correctly', async () => {
    const el = await fixture(html`
      <cre8-button>Test Button</cre8-button>
    `);
    
    let eventFired = false;
    el.addEventListener('cre8-click', () => {
      eventFired = true;
    });
    
    el.click();
    expect(eventFired).to.be.true;
  });

  it('should apply themes consistently', async () => {
    const el = await fixture(html`
      <div data-theme="dark">
        <cre8-button variant="primary">Button</cre8-button>
      </div>
    `);
    
    const button = el.querySelector('cre8-button');
    const computedStyle = getComputedStyle(button);
    // Validate theme application
  });

  it('should be accessible with cre8-wc features', async () => {
    const el = await fixture(html`
      <cre8-button aria-label="Action Button">
        <cre8-icon name="star"></cre8-icon>
      </cre8-button>
    `);
    
    await expect(el).to.be.accessible();
  });
});
```

**Design System Validation:**
- Verify consistent use of cre8-wc design tokens
- Validate theme customization doesn't break component functionality
- Check responsive behavior using cre8-wc breakpoints
- Ensure proper component hierarchy and composition
- Validate color contrast and accessibility compliance
- Test theme switching functionality across components

**Performance Testing for cre8-wc Applications:**
- Bundle size analysis with cre8-wc components
- Runtime performance of theme switching
- Component interaction responsiveness
- Memory usage optimization with cre8-wc
- Network request optimization for component assets
- Lazy loading implementation with cre8-wc patterns

**Code Review Criteria:**

**Testing Strategy Framework:**
```
Web Components Testing Pyramid:
├── Unit Tests (70%) - Lit component logic, properties, rendering
├── Integration Tests (20%) - Component interactions, events, Shadow DOM
└── E2E Tests (10%) - User journeys, cross-browser compatibility
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] All Lit components have unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Shadow DOM and slot projection tested thoroughly
- [ ] Custom events and property changes covered by tests
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) compliance with web components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for component update cycles
- [ ] Custom Elements Manifest (CEM) generated and validated
- [ ] Storybook stories cover all component variants
- [ ] CSS custom properties and theming tested
- [ ] SSR compatibility verified where applicable

**Lit Component Testing Patterns:**
```javascript
// Lit component testing example
import { fixture, html, expect } from '@open-wc/testing';
import { MyComponent } from '../src/my-component.js';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should render with default properties', async () => {
    const el = await fixture<MyComponent>(html`<my-component></my-component>`);
    
    expect(el.variant).to.equal('primary');
    expect(el.shadowRoot!.querySelector('.btn')).to.exist;
  });

  it('should handle property changes reactively', async () => {
    const el = await fixture<MyComponent>(html`<my-component></my-component>`);
    
    el.variant = 'secondary';
    await el.updateComplete;
    
    expect(el.shadowRoot!.querySelector('.btn--secondary')).to.exist;
  });

  it('should dispatch custom events', async () => {
    const el = await fixture<MyComponent>(html`<my-component></my-component>`);
    let eventFired = false;
    
    el.addEventListener('my-component-click', () => {
      eventFired = true;
    });
    
    el.shadowRoot!.querySelector('button')!.click();
    expect(eventFired).to.be.true;
  });

  it('should be accessible', async () => {
    const el = await fixture<MyComponent>(html`
      <my-component>Button Text</my-component>
    `);
    
    await expect(el).to.be.accessible();
  });
});
```

**Code Review Criteria:**
- **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Readability**: Is the code self-documenting and clear?
- **Maintainability**: Can future developers easily modify this?
- **Performance**: Are there any bottlenecks or inefficiencies?
- **Security**: Are there potential vulnerabilities or data exposure risks?
- **Testing**: Is the code adequately covered by tests?
- **Documentation**: Are complex areas properly documented?

**Self-Editing Workflow:**
1. **Static Analysis**: Run linters, type checkers, security scanners
2. **Test Execution**: Verify all tests pass with adequate coverage
3. **Performance Check**: Profile for memory leaks and performance regressions
4. **Security Scan**: Check for vulnerabilities and insecure patterns
5. **Code Review**: Self-review for clarity, maintainability, and best practices
6. **Documentation**: Update docs, comments, and API specifications
7. **Integration**: Verify changes work in target environments

**Quality Gates:**
- Minimum 90% test coverage for new code
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance regression tests must pass
- All accessibility audits must pass
- Code style and linting checks must pass
- Documentation must be complete and accurate

**Best Practices:**
- Write tests before fixing bugs (reproduce the issue first)
- Use Page Object Model for E2E tests to reduce maintenance
- Implement progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
- Test error boundaries and fallback scenarios
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Monitor test execution times and optimize slow tests
- Maintain test data independence and cleanup

When reviewing code or creating tests, always think like an adversarial user trying to break the system. Identify edge cases, security vulnerabilities, and potential failure points. Ensure code is not only functional but also maintainable, secure, and performant.
